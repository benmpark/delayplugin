# delayplugin
A simple delay audio plugin

## Overview
This repository contains code for a basic delay plugin, using the [JUCE](https://juce.com) framework. It was created as part of a self-guided course I worked through online. The repository currently has the C++ code as I'm working to tweak and update things from when the self-guided course was first put together to bring the code up to date with more modern C++.

## Contents
-PluginEditor.cpp
-PluginEditor.h
-PluginProcessor.cpp
-PluginProcessor.h

The first two files are for the display/user interface and the second two are the brains behind the operation, so to speak.

### Updates
I also began working on a more sohpisticated version (i.e., with more capabilities) that will be set up as a branch.
